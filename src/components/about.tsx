                            I'm currently a fourth-year Computer Systems Engineering student at Palestine Polytechnic University. 
                            It's been a pretty intense journey because I've managed to make it to the dean's list for six semesters in a row â€“ quite a feat, 
                            I must say. But it's not just about the grades. 
                            I'm also a problem-solving coach over at the Code Academy within the university with C++ programming language.

                            In my Training in Sada Intelligence I started to learn Web development from scratch starting from 
                            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React JS for the front end development. After that we learn the fundamentals 
                            of NodeJS and ExpressJS with MongoDB for the back end development. And we finished out Training with a 
                            project to implement our knowledge in the Web Development.
